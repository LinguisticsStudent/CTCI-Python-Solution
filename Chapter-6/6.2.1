# Solution 6.2.1

No.
Here is the reasoning. 
1. Each domino covers a black square and a white square. 
2. The two diagonally opposite corners that are cut off are in the same colors. 
In the other word, they are both black squares, or they are both white squares.
3. The remained chess board has 62 squares, 32 white squares and 30 black ones, 
or 32 black squares and 30 white ones.
4. The remained black and white squares don't match in the numbers.
5. In another word, one can not use dominos to pair the squares.
6. No is the final answer.
